# Using Data Visualization 

This notebook is practicing and implamenting some data visualization to help a friend with her thesis.  She collected all the data herself and wanted to find a way to showcase her findings.

- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn

Mostly used bar graphs for comparisons and a line graph to show percentages.
